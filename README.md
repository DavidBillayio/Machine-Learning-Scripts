# Machine-Learning-Scripts
A collection of template machine learning scripts

Knn.py
    Currently this program works for the sklearn digits dataset. It first finds the optimal number of nearest neighbors
    then learns on the dataset. The Quam is then available to be used as a demo.
    
    In the future the demo will iterate to allow testing.
